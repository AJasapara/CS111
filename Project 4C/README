Included Files:
	1. lab4c_tcp.c - 		Contains the source code for reading temperature from a Beaglebone and Grove Temperature Sensor, accepting 
							commands from the TCP server connection, and outputting the temperature reports to the server and a log file.
	2. lab4c_tls.c -		Contains the source code for reading temperature from a Beaglebone and Grove Temperature Sensor, accepting 
							commands securely from the TLS server connection, and outputting the temperature reports securely to the server and a log file.
	3. Makefile - 			make (default) compiles the source code into executables called lab4c_tcp and lab4c_tls, make clean removes all files 
							created by the Makefile, and make dist creates the deliverable tarball.
	4. README - 			This file containing the project description and other comments.

For this project, I heavily referenced the Linux manual on man7.org for the various functions/commands that 
were specified in the spec.
