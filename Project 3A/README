Included Files:
	1. lab3a.c 	- 			Contains the source code for summarizing an EXT2 image with a superblock summary, group summary, free 
							block entries, free I-node entries, I-node summary, directory entries, and indirect block references.
	2. Makefile - 			make (default) compiles the source code into the executable called lab3a, make clean removes all files 
							created by the Makefile, and make dist creates the deliverable tarball.
	3. README - 			This file containing the project description and other comments.
	4. ext2_fs.h -			The given header file containing various structs and variables to represent an EXT2 filesystem.

For this project, I heavily referenced the Linux manual on man7.org for the various functions/commands that 
were specified in the spec.
