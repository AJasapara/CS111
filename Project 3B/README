Included Files:
	1. lab3b.py - 			Contains the source code for analyzing a file system summary and reporting on all discovered inconsistencies.
	2. Makefile - 			make (default) compiles the source code into the executable called lab3b, make clean removes all files 
							created by the Makefile, and make dist creates the deliverable tarball.
	3. README - 			This file containing the project description and other comments.

For this project, I heavily referenced the Linux manual on man7.org for the various functions/commands that 
were specified in the spec.
