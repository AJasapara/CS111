Included Files:
	1. lab4b.c 	- 			Contains the source code for reading temperature from a Beaglebone and Grove Temperature Sensor, accepting 
							commands from the standard input, and allowing a button to be pressed to shutdown the entire program.
	2. Makefile - 			make (default) compiles the source code into the executable called lab4b, make check executes an automated 
							smoke-test of my application to see if it runs and can talk to its sensors/actuators, make clean removes all files 
							created by the Makefile, and make dist creates the deliverable tarball.
	3. README - 			This file containing the project description and other comments.

For this project, I heavily referenced the Linux manual on man7.org for the various functions/commands that 
were specified in the spec.
